# Croquet React Bindings

The `@croquet/react` package provides a simple framework for using Croquet together with React. The main principle of `@croquet/react` is that React components fully assume the role of the View side of Croquet. (Behind the scenes, a normal Croquet View is still created to act as a slim contact point between the Croquet Model and the React components, but all View side logic is implemented in the React components.)

Please also refer to croquet.io/docs for more information.
