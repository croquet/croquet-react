# A Collaborative Musicbox demo based on Croquet

This is a multiplayer application to compose a 2 second looping music. See the [tutorial](https://croquet.io/docs/croquet-react/tutorial-2%20React%20Music%20Box.html).

You can test it on your local computer by making a copy of dot-env-example:

   # cp dot-env-example .env.local

and then insert your Croquet development key obtained from https://croquet.io/keys into `.env.local`.

Then run: 

   # npm install
   # npm run dev

You can deploy it to your server by making a copy of dot-env-example:

   # cp dot-env-example .env.production

and insert your Croquet production key obtained from https://croquet.io/keys into `.env.production`.

Then run:
  
   # npm run build

and files generated in the `dist` directory to your server.
