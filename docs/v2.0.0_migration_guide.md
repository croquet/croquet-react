# v2.0.0 Migration Guide

This update introduces significant improvements to the way models and views interact.
We focused on automatically updating the view side whenever the model changes, simplifying the overall workflow.
Additionally, new features have been added to enhance the developer experience, such as dynamically connecting to new sessions and accessing a list of connected views.

To see these changes in action, check out the following example repositories:

 * [Counter](https://github.com/croquet/croquet-react-counter)
 * [Music Box](https://github.com/croquet/croquet-react-musicbox)
 * [Mondrian](https://github.com/croquet/croquet-react-mondrian/)

## Updating existing code

<a id="model-side"></a>
### Model side

1. **Your model should inherit from `ReactModel`**

Update your existing models to inherit from the `ReactModel` class.
The `ReactModel` class is a new base class introduced in this update, which allows which allows the view side to be automatically updated whenever the model changes.

```ts
import { ReactModel } from "@croquet/react";

class CounterModel extends ReactModel {
  // Your model logic goes here
}
```

2. **No need to publish output events**

If your model events were exclusively published to update the view side, you may drop them. The `ReactModel` class automatically handles the updates to the view side.

```ts
class CounterModel extends ReactModel {
  resetCounter() {
    this.count = 0;
    
    // Remove the line below:
    // this.publish(this.id, "count");
  }
}
```

3. **Override the `handleViewJoin` and `handleViewExit` methods**

Subscribing directly to `view-join` and `view-exit` events is not supported in this version.
Instead, you should override the `handleViewJoin` and `handleViewExit` methods.

```ts
class YourModel extends ReactModel {
  init(option) {
    super.init(option)

    // Remove the lines below:
    // this.subscribe(this.id, "view-join", this.handleViewJoin);
    // this.subscribe(this.id, "view-exit", this.handleViewExit);

  }

  // Override these methods instead
  handleViewJoin(viewId) { /* ... */ }
  handleViewJoin(viewId) { /* ... */ }
}
```


<a id="view-side"></a>
### View side

1. **Use the `useReactModelRoot` hook, instead of `useModelRoot`**

In your view side, replace the `useModelRoot` hook with the new `useReactModelRoot` hook.
This new hook returns a stateful object that will be automatically updated whenever the model changes.

```tsx
import { useReactModelRoot } from "@croquet/react";

function CounterView() {
  const model = useReactModelRoot<CounterModel>();
}
```

2. **Remove state that was used to represent the model data**

Since `useReactModelRoot` returns a stateful object, you don't need to create a React state to represent the model.

```tsx
function CounterView() {
  // Remove the line below:
  // const [count, setCount] = useState(model.count);

  const count = model.count;
}
```

3. **You don't _need_ to subscribe to model events anymore**

The `useReactModelRoot` hook ensures that your view components always have access to the latest state of the model, without the need for explicit event subscriptions or manual updates.
However, if your logic requires you to subscribe to specific events, this behavior is still supported.

```tsx
function CounterView() {
  // Remove the line below
  // useSubscribe(model.id, "count", () => setCount(model.count), []);
}
```

4. **Call the model handlers instead of using `usePublish`**

The object returned by `useReactModelRoot` has the same interface as the root model of your application, so you can call the model event handlers directly. 
Those functions publish the event that will be handled by the respective function, but it feels like you are calling the model methods directly, which is nice!

Using the `usePublish` hook is still supported.

```tsx
function CounterView() {
    // Remove the line below
    // const publishReset = usePublish(() => [model.id, "reset"], []);

    // Make sure the DOM event is not passed to the method
    return (
      <div onClick={(_) => model.reset()}>
        {model.count}
      </div>
    );
}
```


<a id="new-features"></a>
## New features

<a id="change-session"></a>
1. **Dynamically connecting to a new session**

If you ever need to change the session your application is connected to, you can simply use the function returned by the `useChangeSession` hook.
This will cause the `<CroquetRoot/>` component to connect to leave the current session and connect to a new one.

```tsx
import { useChangeSession } from '@croquet/react'

export default function YourComponent() {
    const changeSession = useChangeSession()

    const handleConnectNewSession = (newSessionName, newSessionPassword) {
        changeSession({ name: s.name, password: s.password })
    }
}
```

<a id="connected-views"></a>
2. **Access all the connected views with the `useConnectedViews` hook**

We also introcuded a new hook `useConnectedViews` that gives you access to a list of views that are connected to the same session.


```tsx
import { useConnectedViews } from '@croquet/react'

export default function YourComponent() {
    const { views, viewCount } = useConnectedViews()

    return (
        <>
            <p>Listing all {viewCount} views:</p>
            <ul>{ views.map((v) => <li>{v}</li>) }</ul>
        </>
    )
}
```

We made this feature opt-in, so you will need to configure it in your `<CroquetRoot/>` component

```tsx
export default function Wrapper() {
    return (
        <CroquetRoot
            sessionParams={{
                // ... other configuration
                options: { trackViews: true }
            }}
        >
            <App/>
        </CroquetRoot>
    )
}

```
